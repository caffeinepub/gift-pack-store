  "summary": "The diff implements most of the edit functionality requirements for the admin dashboard. Backend mutations for updating gift packs are implemented, frontend hooks and UI components support edit mode with pre-populated forms, and toast notifications follow the existing pattern. However, backend update functions for categories and coupons are missing (only placeholders exist), and there is no evidence of product edit functionality implementation.",

      "reason": "The backend file (backend/main.mo) was truncated, but the frontend hooks (useCategoryMutation.ts and useCouponMutation.ts) contain placeholder comments indicating 'Backend updateCategory/updateCoupon method not yet implemented' and call createCategory/createCoupon instead of actual update functions.",
