  "summary": "The diff shows that backend admin authentication functionality (REQ-1) was not implemented, while frontend changes (REQ-2) remain unchanged with hardcoded validation. The backend/main.mo was modified but the diff is truncated, showing only type definitions without any admin authentication endpoint or credential storage implementation. The frontend useAdminAuth.tsx still validates credentials locally instead of calling a backend endpoint.",

      "reason": "The backend/main.mo diff shows only type definitions (GiftItem, GiftPack, Cart, Order, etc.) and Map declarations, but no admin authentication endpoint, no adminLogin function, and no visible storage of admin credentials. The truncated diff does not show any authentication logic being added.",

      "reason": "The useAdminAuth.tsx file still contains hardcoded validation logic (ADMIN_USERNAME = 'admin', ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'admin') with local authentication checks. The login function performs client-side validation ('if (username === ADMIN_USERNAME && password === ADMIN_PASSWORD)') instead of calling a backend authentication endpoint. No backend API call is present.",
