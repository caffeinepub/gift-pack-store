  "summary": "The implementation introduces a frontend-only admin authentication system using hardcoded credentials and localStorage, which does not meet REQ-1's requirement for backend authentication with secure credential storage. The implementation successfully addresses REQ-2 (admin login page), REQ-3 (route protection with session persistence), and REQ-4 (conditional admin navigation link). However, the lack of backend involvement means credentials are exposed in client-side code, authentication can be easily bypassed, and the system cannot scale or be configured without code changes.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Backend stores admin credentials securely",
      "reason": "Admin credentials are hardcoded in frontend code (frontend/src/hooks/useAdminAuth.tsx) as plaintext constants (ADMIN_USERNAME='admin', ADMIN_PASSWORD='admin123'). No backend storage or validation is implemented despite requirement explicitly stating backend authentication system.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Backend provides a method to validate username and password combinations",
      "reason": "Authentication logic is entirely client-side in useAdminAuth hook. No backend method exists for credential validation. The backend/main.mo file shows no admin authentication methods were added.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Backend returns authentication success or failure status",
      "reason": "No backend communication occurs during authentication. The login function in useAdminAuth simulates async behavior but performs only local string comparison, returning boolean without backend interaction.",
